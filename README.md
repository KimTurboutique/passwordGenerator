# Password Generator

This password generator was built for the Bootcamp Week 3 Challenge. I applied the knowledge and skills I gained from week three's classes to modify the starter code and generate a random password for employees.

* HTML and CSS was dynamically updated.
* UI adapts to multiple screen sizes
* The password was generated to include special characters or numbers, upper and lowercase letters.
